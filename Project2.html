						<p> This was a project done with a group for a beetweight Combot Robotics Competition run of SJSU ASME held in the end of the 2024 Spring Semester. I acted as group leader where I worked on getting parts for an appropriate budget and tracked team progress to finish the robot on time. Additionally, as a team member I worked on the weapon and chassis design. The weapon is a hammersaw where a servo spins the steel saw and a servo controls the arm. At the front, there are front forks and armor that are interchangible between games. At the side, there is TPU armor that can absorb collision shocks. As we had trouble printing in nylon, PLA was used instead which definitely hindered the robot's performance. Minus Eye Queue ultimately went 1-2 in the tournament.</p>

						<p> The year after, a redesign was worked on for a second competition where many improvements were made. These included a fully Nylon Chassis that is easier to print, more secure support ball caster wheel for movement, redesigned aluminum weapon arm, more powerful motor, and front forks that can be used in combination with the front armor. Unfortunately, the competition was cancelled and thus, the robot redesign was discontinued.</p>
