						<p> This was a semester project done with a group for a mechatronics class. The purpose was to make a marble machine that is small enough so that it can fit on your desk to toy around with when you are bored. It functions by dropping small marbles that are loaded on on a 16 by 16 grid to make pixel art. The marble plate and dropper are controlled by stepper motors via a belt system, while the dropping action is done via a servo. Whether a marble is dropped or not is confirmed by an IR sensor that senses the dropped marble. This is entirely controlled by joysticks and a button. I was in charge of mainly the mechanical components. This included making the aluminum frame and designing the belt systems for the marble plate and dropper. Additionally, torque and power calculations were done to figure out the appropriate motors. </p>

						<p> A redesign was done by myself during the summer. Some improvements were a smaller dropper with a more tensioned belt system, less wiring that is kept underneath, attached container for marbles, and the external controllers now replaced with movement being controlled by keys on my laptop. This made the marble machine significantly more compact and better work as a plaything that can fit on your desk. </p>
