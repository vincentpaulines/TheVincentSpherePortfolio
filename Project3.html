						<p> This was a project done for my mechanical engineering design class where our group had to make a design utilizing a 4 bar mechanism. We accomplished this using a rocker connected to a roller in ink that is tensioned from springs to print designs on business card sized paper. In this team, I mainly worked on the CAD in Solidworks. Designing the roller mechanism and accompanying support structures. This was 3D printed using PLA and TPU for the roller. Calculations on the occuring loads and material stresses were also made using Matlab to ensure failure does not occur.</p>
						<a href = "Project4.html">For this project, I also utilized my Heatset Insert Press to align the heatset inserts just right which you can see </a>
